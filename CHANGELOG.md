# Changelog

All notable changes to `lindhard` and `lindhard-cli` are recorded here. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the crates use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (both crates share
one version).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Packaging metadata for both crates: `include` allowlists, crate-local
  README, LICENSE and CHANGELOG in each archive, and a CI `package` job that
  runs `cargo package` and `cargo publish --dry-run`.

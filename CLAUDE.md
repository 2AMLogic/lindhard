# lindhard

A clean-room, MIT-licensed Rust engine for Monte Carlo transport of ions and
electrons in matter. Before writing code, read `CONTRIBUTING.md`, in
particular the **clean-room license tiers** (what may be ported, what may only
be read about in papers, and what may never enter the tree) and the
**disclosure** section. Then read `docs/architecture.md`.

- Physics comes from published papers. Every model and constant cites its
  source in a doc comment.
- Every dataset gets a row in `docs/data-provenance.md`. No SRIM-derived
  tables, ever.
- Determinism across thread counts is a tested invariant. Do not break it.
- This repo is public. Keep it free of anything that is not already
  published physics, and of any description of downstream applications.

<!-- BEGIN LOOM ORCHESTRATION -->
This repository uses [Loom](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom) for AI-powered development orchestration — see the Loom repository for the full guide (roles, labels, worktrees, configuration). When installed, Loom also writes a locally-substituted copy of that guide to `.loom/CLAUDE.md`.

Work is coordinated through `loom:` labels on issues and pull requests, and the same roles run either under `loom-daemon` or by hand in an attended session — daemon mode is optional. Create the labels once with `.loom/scripts/sync-labels.sh` (an install ships `.github/labels.yml` but does not create the labels on the forge). A pull request ready for review carries `loom:review-requested`; Judge reviews it and applies `loom:pr` (approved) or `loom:changes-requested`; Doctor fixes a `loom:changes-requested` pull request and returns it to `loom:review-requested`. Only a `loom:pr` pull request gets merged, and always via this repo's merge script (`.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh`) — never a raw forge merge command such as `gh pr merge`. Full state machine: `.loom/docs/label-state-machine.md`.

<!-- BEGIN REPO-SKILLS -->
This repository has [Repo Skills](https://github.com/rjwalters/repo) v0.19.8 installed —
general repository hygiene and environment commands invoked as `/repo:<command>`. Run
`/repo:help` for the command list, or see `.claude/skills/repo/SKILL.md` for the full
guide. Hygiene commands apply safe, reversible fixes by default and report each
change; run with `--ask` to review first, and `--prune` to allow irreversible
removals. Managed by `install.sh` — edit outside the markers only.
